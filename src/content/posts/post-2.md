<h1>What Does Programming Mean?</h1>
Programming is the implementation of logic to facilitate specified computing operations and functionality. It occurs in one or more languages, which differ by application, domain and programming model.

<h1>Techopedia Explains Programming</h1>
Programming language semantics and syntax are used when constructing an application. Thus, programming requires knowledge of application domains, algorithms and programming language expertise.

Programming language logic differs by developer. From a high level, good code can be evaluated with factors such as:
<ul>
<li>Robustness: Focuses on program continuation capability, regardless of errors or incorrect data</li>
<li>Reliability: Focuses on correct design and algorithm implementation</li>
<li>Efficiency: Focuses on memory, hardware or other properties used to optimize programs</li>
<li>Readability: Proper documentation and indentation availability, which provides insight to other program developers or designers</li>
</ul>
